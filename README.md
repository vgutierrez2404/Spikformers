# Spikformer 
Bio-inspired theoretical report

In this paper [**Friendly introduction to Spikformers: how self attention modules can be integrated into Spiking Neural Networks**](Paper/Friendly%20introduction%20to%20Spikformers.pdf)
we reviewed how the self-attention mechanism of the Transformer model can be integrated into Spiking Neural Networks, based on the paper "**Spikformer: when Spiking Neural Networks meets Transformer**"
